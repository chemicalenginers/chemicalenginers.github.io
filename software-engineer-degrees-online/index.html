</p>
<h3>Flexibility</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Flexibility%2C%20engine&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" title="Flexibility, Engine" alt="Flexibility, Engine" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
</center>
<p>
  Flexibility is one of the key benefits of online software engineer degrees. With an online program, you can learn at your own pace and on your own time, making it possible to balance school with work and other commitments. This flexibility is especially important for working professionals who want to advance their careers without having to quit their jobs. For example, a software engineer who works full-time can take one or two courses per semester, and complete their degree in a few years. This flexibility would not be possible with a traditional on-campus program, which typically requires students to attend classes at specific times and locations.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to working professionals, online software engineer degrees are also a good option for people who have family obligations or other commitments that make it difficult to attend traditional on-campus classes. For example, a parent with young children can take online courses while their children are napping or sleeping. This flexibility allows people who might not otherwise be able to pursue a higher education to achieve their goals.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, the flexibility of online software engineer degrees makes them a valuable option for working professionals, parents, and other individuals who need to balance school with other commitments.
</p>
<h3>Affordability</h3>

<p>
  The affordability of online software engineer degrees is a major benefit for many students. Online programs typically have lower tuition costs than traditional on-campus programs, and they also eliminate the need for students to pay for transportation, parking, and other expenses associated with attending school. This can save students a significant amount of money over the course of their degree program.
</p>
<p>
  For example, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign offers an online Master of Science in Computer Science degree for $21,756. The same degree program on campus costs $32,576. This represents a savings of over $10,000 for students who choose to complete the program online.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to tuition costs, online programs also save students money on other expenses, such as transportation, parking, and childcare. For example, a student who lives in a rural area and attends an online program can save money on gas and car maintenance costs. A student with children can save money on childcare costs by taking online courses while their children are at school or daycare.
</p>
<p>
  The affordability of online software engineer degrees makes them a valuable option for students who are looking to save money on their education. Online programs can help students achieve their career goals without having to go into debt.
