<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Cross-platform%2C%20engine&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" title="Cross-platform, Engine" alt="Cross-platform, Engine" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
</center>
<p>
  The cross-platform nature of Lua game engines is a significant advantage. It allows developers to create games that can be played on a wide range of devices, without the need to port the game to each platform individually. This can save developers a significant amount of time and effort, and it can also help to ensure that their games reach a wider audience.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a developer could create a Lua game that can be played on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android. This would allow the developer to reach a much larger audience than if they were to only release the game on one platform. Additionally, the developer would not need to spend time and effort porting the game to each individual platform.
</p>
<p>
  The cross-platform nature of Lua game engines is a major reason why they are so popular among game developers. It allows developers to create games that can be played by a wide range of people, without having to worry about the technical challenges of porting the game to different platforms.
</p>
<h3>Easy to use</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Easy%20to%20use%2C%20engine&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" title="Easy To Use, Engine" alt="Easy To Use, Engine" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
</center>
<p>
  The ease of use of Lua is a major advantage for Lua game engines. It makes it possible for developers of all skill levels to create games with Lua. This is especially important for beginner game developers, who may not have the experience or knowledge to use more complex game engines.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a beginner game developer could use a Lua game engine to create a simple 2D platformer game. The developer would not need to have any prior experience with game development or programming. They could simply follow the documentation for the Lua game engine and learn how to use the engine's features to create their game.
</p>
<p>
  The ease of use of Lua game engines also makes it possible for experienced game developers to create more complex games more quickly and easily. Experienced game developers can use the Lua game engine's features to create sophisticated games without having to write a lot of complex code.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, the ease of use of Lua game engines is a major benefit for game developers of all skill levels. It makes it possible for beginner game developers to create simple games quickly and easily, and it makes it possible for experienced game developers to create more complex games more quickly and easily.

    <br/>
</center>
<p>
  The extensibility of Lua game engines is a major advantage, as it allows developers to create custom games that are tailored to their specific needs. For example, a developer could create a Lua game engine module that adds support for a new type of physics engine, or a new type of graphics engine. This would allow the developer to create games that use the new features provided by the module.
</p>
<p>
  Another example of how extensibility can be used is to create custom game AI. A developer could create a Lua game engine module that adds support for a new type of AI algorithm. This would allow the developer to create games with more intelligent and challenging AI opponents.
</p>
<p>
  The extensibility of Lua game engines is limited only by the imagination of the developer. By creating custom game engine modules, developers can create games that are unique and innovative.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, the extensibility of Lua game engines is a major advantage for game developers. It allows developers to create custom games that are tailored to their specific needs, and it allows them to create games with unique and innovative features.
