    <br/>
</center>
<p>
  Affordability is a major benefit of online degree programs. Online programs are typically less expensive than traditional on-campus programs. This is because online programs do not have the same overhead costs, such as classrooms, faculty salaries, and housing. Online students can also save money on transportation and other expenses.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a recent study by the National Center for Education Statistics found that the average cost of tuition and fees for a four-year public college is over $20,000 per year. The average cost of tuition and fees for a four-year private college is over $40,000 per year. In contrast, the average cost of tuition and fees for an online degree program is less than $15,000 per year.
</p>
<p>
  The affordability of online degree programs makes them a great option for students who are looking to save money on their education. Online programs can also help students avoid debt. According to a recent study by the Institute for College Access &amp; Success, the average student loan debt for a four-year college graduate is over $30,000. Online degree programs can help students avoid this debt by providing them with a more affordable option.
