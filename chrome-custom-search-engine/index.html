  A custom search engine refers to a modified or specialized search engine that is designed to focus on a specific website or a set of websites. Created using Google's Custom Search Engine (CSE), it offers a tailored search experience, allowing users to search within a predefined scope of content.
</p>
<p>
  The key benefit of a custom search engine lies in its ability to enhance the search experience for users seeking information within a specific domain or a group of related websites. Unlike general-purpose search engines that scour the entire web, a custom search engine limits its search to a curated collection of web pages, resulting in more relevant and targeted search results. This focused approach makes it an invaluable tool for organizations, businesses, and individuals who want to provide their users with a streamlined and efficient search experience.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
  Custom search engines have gained popularity due to their versatility and ease of implementation. They can be easily integrated into websites, online platforms, and applications, allowing content owners to offer a branded and customized search experience to their users. This integration helps in improving user engagement, website traffic, and overall user satisfaction.
</p>
<h2>
