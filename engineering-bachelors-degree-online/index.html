<p>
  The cost of higher education has been rising steadily for decades, making it increasingly difficult for students to afford a college degree. Engineering programs are particularly expensive, as they require specialized equipment and facilities. However, online engineering bachelor's degrees offer a more affordable option for students.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Tuition:</strong> Online programs often have lower tuition rates than traditional on-campus programs. This is because online programs do not have the same overhead costs, such as the cost of maintaining a physical campus and paying for faculty to teach in person.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Fees:</strong> Online programs also typically have lower fees than traditional on-campus programs. This is because online programs do not have to pay for things like parking, student activities, and health services.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Other costs:</strong> In addition to tuition and fees, students in traditional on-campus programs also have to pay for things like transportation, housing, and food. Online students do not have to pay for these costs, which can save them a significant amount of money.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
