    <br/>
</center>
<p>
  The flexibility of online engineering degrees is one of their key advantages. Students can learn at their own pace, without having to attend traditional on-campus classes. This makes it an ideal option for working professionals, stay-at-home parents, and other individuals who may not have the time or resources to attend a traditional college or university.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a working professional who wants to earn an engineering degree can take online courses in the evenings and on weekends, while still maintaining their full-time job. A stay-at-home parent can take online courses during naptime or after the kids have gone to bed. And an individual who lives in a rural area can take online courses without having to travel to a distant college or university.
</p>
<p>
  The flexibility of online engineering degrees makes it possible for individuals from all walks of life to pursue a higher education and advance their careers.
</p>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
