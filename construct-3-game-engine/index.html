<h3>Animation Tools</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Animation%20Tools%2C%20engine&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" title="Animation Tools, Engine" alt="Animation Tools, Engine" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
</center>
<p>
  Construct 3's animation tools empower developers to create dynamic and engaging character animations. It supports both sprite-based animation and skeletal animation, providing developers with the flexibility to choose the most suitable approach for their game's art style and gameplay requirements.
</p>
<p>
  Sprite-based animation involves creating individual sprites for each frame of animation, which are then played back in sequence to create the illusion of movement. This technique is commonly used in 2D games and is particularly effective for creating pixel art animations with a retro or handcrafted look. Construct 3 provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating and editing sprites, making it easy for artists and animators to bring their characters to life.
</p>
<p>
  Skeletal animation, on the other hand, uses a system of bones and joints to define a character's skeleton. Animators can then pose the skeleton and create keyframes to define the character's movement. Construct 3's skeletal animation system is fully integrated with its physics engine, allowing for realistic and dynamic character movement. This technique is commonly used in 3D games and is ideal for creating fluid and lifelike animations.
</p>
<p>
  The combination of sprite-based animation and skeletal animation in Construct 3 provides developers with a powerful toolset for creating visually appealing and engaging character animations. These tools empower developers to bring their characters to life and create immersive and memorable gaming experiences.
