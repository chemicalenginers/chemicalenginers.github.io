    <br/>
</center>
<p>
  Local SEO is a key component of enterprise search engine optimization (SEO). By optimizing your website for local search results, you can improve your visibility and ranking in search results for people in your local area. This can lead to increased traffic, leads, and sales.
</p>

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 2: Search volume</strong><br />
    <p>
      Local SEO can be a great way to reach people who are searching for products or services in your local area. For example, if you are a restaurant, you would want to optimize your website for local search results so that people in your local area can find you when they are searching for restaurants.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 3: Competition</strong><br />
    <p>
      Local SEO can be less competitive than national SEO. This means that it may be easier to rank for local search terms than it is to rank for national search terms. This can make local SEO a great option for businesses that are just starting out with SEO.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Facet 4: Long-tail keywords</strong><br />
    <p>
      Long-tail keywords are phrases that are more specific than single keywords. They are typically longer and more conversational. For example, instead of targeting the keyword "lawyer", you could target the long-tail keyword "criminal defense lawyer in New York City".
    </p>
