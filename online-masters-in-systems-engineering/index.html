  An online Master's in Systems Engineering culminates in a capstone project, which is a substantial project that demonstrates the student's ability to apply systems engineering principles to a real-world problem. The capstone project is a critical component of the program, as it provides students with the opportunity to synthesize their learning and apply it to a practical problem.
</p>
<p>
  Capstone projects can take various forms, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designing and developing a new system
  </li>
  <li>Improving an existing system
  </li>
  <li>Conducting a feasibility study for a new system
  </li>
  <li>Developing a systems engineering process or methodology
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Through the capstone project, students gain valuable experience in applying systems engineering principles to solve complex problems. They learn how to define system requirements, design and develop system architectures, and integrate and test systems. They also learn how to manage projects and work effectively in teams.
</p>
<p>
  The capstone project is a valuable learning experience for students, and it also serves as a valuable credential for graduates. It demonstrates to potential employers that the graduate has the skills and knowledge necessary to be a successful systems engineer.
