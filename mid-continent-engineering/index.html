  Safety engineering is a critical component of mid continent engineering, ensuring the safety of workers, the public, and the environment during the planning, construction, and operation of infrastructure projects. In the Mid-Continent region, safety engineering takes on due to the region's unique challenges, such as extreme weather events, diverse terrain, and complex geological formations.
</p>
<p>
  One of the primary connections between safety engineering and mid continent engineering is the need to address the risks associated with extreme weather events. The Mid-Continent region is prone to tornadoes, hurricanes, and ice storms, which can cause significant damage to infrastructure and pose safety hazards to workers and the public. Safety engineers work closely with other engineers and project managers to design and implement safety measures to mitigate these risks.
</p>
<p>
  For example, safety engineers may design structures to withstand high winds and wind-borne debris, and they may develop emergency response plans to ensure the safety of workers and the public in the event of a natural disaster.
