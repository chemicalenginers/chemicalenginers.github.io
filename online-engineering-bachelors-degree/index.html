<p>
  Technology requirements are a critical component of online engineering bachelor's degree programs. Without access to a computer and a reliable internet connection, students would not be able to complete their coursework or participate in online discussions and activities. This requirement ensures that students have the necessary tools to succeed in an online learning environment.
</p>
<p>
  The importance of technology requirements for online engineering bachelor's degree programs cannot be overstated. In addition to providing students with the ability to complete their coursework, technology requirements also allow students to access a variety of learning resources, such as online lectures, tutorials, and simulations. These resources can help students to learn at their own pace and on their own time.
</p>
<p>
  For example, Arizona State University's online engineering bachelor's degree program requires students to have access to a computer with a webcam and microphone, as well as a reliable internet connection. These requirements ensure that students can participate in online lectures and discussions, and that they can access the program's online learning resources.
</p>
<p>
  The technology requirements for online engineering bachelor's degree programs are essential for student success. By ensuring that students have access to the necessary technology, online engineering bachelor's degree programs can help students to achieve their academic goals.
