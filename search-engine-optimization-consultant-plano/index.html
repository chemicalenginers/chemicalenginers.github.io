  SEO analytics is the process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting on website traffic data to improve a website's search engine optimization (SEO). SEO analytics can be used to track a variety of metrics, including organic search traffic, keyword rankings, backlinks, and conversion rates. This data can then be used to identify areas for improvement and to make informed decisions about SEO strategy.

By tracking website traffic data, SEO consultants can see how their efforts are impacting a website's visibility and ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs). This data can then be used to make adjustments to the SEO campaign as needed.
</p>

  For example, if an SEO consultant sees that a website's organic search traffic is declining, they can use SEO analytics to identify the cause of the decline. This data could then be used to make changes to the website's content, structure, or backlinks.
