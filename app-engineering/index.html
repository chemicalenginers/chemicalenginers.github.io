</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Encryption:</strong> Encryption is one of the most important security measures that app engineers can implement. Encryption scrambles data so that it cannot be read by unauthorized users. This is especially important for data that is stored on a device or transmitted over a network.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Authentication:</strong> Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. This can be done through a variety of means, such as passwords, PINs, or biometrics. Authentication is important for preventing unauthorized users from accessing an app or its data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Authorization:</strong> Authorization is the process of determining what a user is allowed to do within an app. This is typically done through a role-based access control system, which assigns different permissions to different user roles. Authorization is important for preventing unauthorized users from accessing sensitive data or performing unauthorized actions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Vulnerability management:</strong> Vulnerability management is the process of identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities in an app. This is an ongoing process, as new vulnerabilities are constantly being discovered. App engineers should regularly scan their apps for vulnerabilities and patch any that are found.
