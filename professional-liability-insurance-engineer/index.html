  For example, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) has developed a set of standards for the practice of civil engineering. These standards address a variety of topics, including risk management, design, construction, and maintenance. Engineers who are familiar with these standards can use them to develop risk management plans that are tailored to the specific needs of their clients.
</p>
<p>
  Another example is the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE). NSPE has developed a code of ethics for engineers. This code of ethics provides guidance to engineers on how to conduct themselves in a professional manner. Engineers who follow this code of ethics are less likely to be involved in professional liability claims.
</p>By being familiar with industry standards and best practices, professional liability insurance engineers can provide valuable advice to businesses and individuals on how to manage their professional liability risks. This advice can help businesses and individuals reduce their exposure to claims and protect their assets.
