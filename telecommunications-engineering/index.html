  <li>
    <strong>Authentication</strong><br />
    Authentication is another important security measure used in telecommunications engineering. Authentication verifies the identity of users before they are allowed to access a telecommunications system. This helps to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to sensitive data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Firewalls</strong><br />
    Firewalls are network security devices that block unauthorized access to a telecommunications system. Firewalls can be used to protect telecommunications systems from a variety of threats, including viruses, malware, and hackers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Intrusion Detection Systems</strong><br />
    Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are security devices that monitor telecommunications systems for suspicious activity. IDSs can help to detect and prevent unauthorized access to telecommunications systems.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These are just a few of the security measures used in telecommunications engineering. Telecommunications engineers play a vital role in securing telecommunications systems and protecting user data.
