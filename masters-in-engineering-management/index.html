<p>
  In today's increasingly globalized economy, it is more important than ever for engineers to have a global perspective. MEM programs recognize this and incorporate a global perspective into their curricula, preparing students to work in a global economy.
</p>
<p>
  There are several reasons why a global perspective is important for engineering managers. First, engineering managers are increasingly likely to work on projects that involve multiple countries and cultures. For example, an engineering manager may be responsible for managing a project to build a new manufacturing plant in China. In order to be successful, the engineering manager must understand the Chinese culture and business practices.
</p>
<p>
  Second, engineering managers need to be able to communicate effectively with people from different cultures. For example, an engineering manager may need to give a presentation to a group of investors from Japan. In order to be effective, the engineering manager must be able to communicate in a way that is clear and respectful of Japanese culture.
</p>
<p>
  Third, engineering managers need to be able to understand the global market for their products and services. For example, an engineering manager who is responsible for developing a new product must understand the global demand for that product. In order to make informed decisions about product development, the engineering manager must have a global perspective.
</p>
<p>
  MEM programs provide students with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in a global economy. Students learn about global business practices, cross-cultural communication, and the global market for engineering products and services.
</p>
<p>
