  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Damages</strong><br />
    If a lawsuit is successful, the engineer may be held liable for damages. Professional engineer insurance provides coverage for damages awarded to the claimant, subject to the policy limits. This coverage can help protect the engineer's personal assets and financial stability.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Reputation Protection</strong><br />
    A lawsuit, even if unsuccessful, can damage an engineer's reputation. Professional engineer insurance can help protect the engineer's reputation by providing coverage for the costs of public relations and other measures to mitigate reputational damage.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In conclusion, the coverage provided by professional engineer insurance against financial losses due to lawsuits alleging errors or omissions in professional services is essential for protecting engineers from financial and reputational risks. It ensures that engineers can practice their profession with confidence, knowing that they have financial protection in the event of a claim.

</p>
<p>
  This is particularly important because engineering projects can have long-term consequences. For example, a structural engineer may not discover a design flaw until years after the building is constructed. Without claims-made coverage, the engineer could be left financially responsible for the damages, even though the error occurred during the policy period.
