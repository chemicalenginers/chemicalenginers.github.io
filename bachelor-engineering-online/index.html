<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Flexibility%2C%20engine&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" title="Flexibility, Engine" alt="Flexibility, Engine" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
</center>
<p>
  Flexibility is a key component of online bachelor's in engineering programs. It allows students to complete their coursework at their own pace and on their own schedule, which is ideal for working adults and other students who have commitments that make it difficult to attend traditional on-campus classes.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a student who works full-time may not be able to attend traditional on-campus classes that meet once or twice a week. However, with an online program, the student can complete their coursework at their own pace, logging in to the online learning platform whenever they have time. This flexibility allows students to balance their work, school, and personal commitments while still earning their degree.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, online programs often offer a wider range of courses than traditional on-campus programs. This flexibility allows students to tailor their education to their specific interests and career goals.
</p>
<p>
  The flexibility of online bachelor's in engineering programs is a major benefit for students who need to balance their education with other commitments. It allows students to learn at their own pace, on their own schedule, and in a way that meets their individual needs.
</p>
<h3>Affordability</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Affordability%2C%20engine&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" title="Affordability, Engine" alt="Affordability, Engine" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
</center>
<p>
  Affordability is a major concern for many students, and online bachelor's in engineering programs can be a more affordable option than traditional on-campus programs. The cost of tuition and fees for online programs is often lower than the cost of tuition and fees for on-campus programs. In addition, online programs can save students money on other expenses, such as transportation, parking, and childcare.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a recent study by the National Center for Education Statistics found that the average cost of tuition and fees for an online bachelor's degree in engineering was $26,900, while the average cost of tuition and fees for an on-campus bachelor's degree in engineering was $32,400. In addition, online students can save money on other expenses, such as transportation, parking, and childcare. These savings can add up to a significant amount of money over the course of a four-year degree program.
</p>
<p>
  Affordability is an important consideration for many students, and online bachelor's in engineering programs can be a more affordable option than traditional on-campus programs. By carefully considering the costs of both types of programs, students can make an informed decision about which type of program is right for them.
</p>
<h3>Access to a wider range of courses and faculty</h3>
