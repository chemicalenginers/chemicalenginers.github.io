  Engineering online degrees are academic programs that allow students to earn a bachelor's or master's degree in engineering entirely online. These programs are designed for working professionals, students with family obligations, or anyone who cannot attend traditional on-campus classes.
</p>
<p>
  Online engineering degrees offer several benefits over traditional programs. First, they are more flexible and convenient, allowing students to learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. Second, they are often more affordable than traditional programs, as students do not have to pay for travel, parking, or other expenses associated with attending on-campus classes. Third, online engineering degrees can be just as rigorous as traditional programs, and graduates of online programs are just as likely to be successful in their careers.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
  The history of online engineering degrees dates back to the early 1990s, when a few universities began offering online courses. However, it was not until the late 1990s and early 2000s that online engineering degrees became widely available. Today, many universities offer online engineering degrees, and the number of students enrolled in these programs is growing rapidly.

<p>
  The global reach of online engineering degrees is one of their most significant advantages. Students from all over the world can access these programs, regardless of their location. This is especially beneficial for students who live in remote areas or who do not have access to traditional on-campus engineering programs.
</p>
<p>
  For example, a student who lives in a rural area may not have access to a local university that offers an engineering program. However, this student can enroll in an online engineering program from a university in another state or even another country. This allows the student to earn an engineering degree without having to relocate.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, online engineering degrees can be a great option for students who want to learn from the best universities and professors. Many top universities offer online engineering programs, which means that students can learn from the same faculty who teach on-campus programs.
