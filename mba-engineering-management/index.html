<h3>Ethics</h3>
<center>
    <img class="v-cover ads-img" src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=Ethics%2C%20engine&w=1280&h=720&c=5&rs=1&p=0" title="Ethics, Engine" alt="Ethics, Engine" width="100%" style="margin-right: 8px;margin-bottom: 8px;" />
    <br/>
</center>
<p>
  Ethics plays a crucial role in MBA Engineering Management. Engineering Management graduates are expected to make decisions that are not only technically sound but also ethically responsible. This is especially important in the engineering and technology industries, where decisions can have a significant impact on society and the environment.
</p>
<p>
  For example, an Engineering Management graduate working in the automotive industry may be faced with the decision of whether to use a new material in a car's braking system. The new material is lighter and less expensive than the traditional material, but it has not been fully tested for safety. The graduate must weigh the potential benefits of the new material against the potential risks, and make a decision that is in the best interests of the company and the public.
</p>
<p>
  Another example of the importance of ethics in Engineering Management is the case of the Volkswagen emissions scandal. In 2015, it was revealed that Volkswagen had installed software in its diesel cars that allowed them to cheat on emissions tests. This software allowed the cars to emit more pollution than was legally allowed. The scandal resulted in billions of dollars in fines for Volkswagen and a loss of trust in the company.
</p>
<p>
  The Volkswagen emissions scandal is a reminder of the importance of ethical decision-making in Engineering Management.
