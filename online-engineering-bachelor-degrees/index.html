  Graduates of online engineering bachelor's degree programs have the opportunity to advance their careers by pursuing a master's degree or doctorate in engineering. This is because a master's degree or doctorate provides engineers with the advanced skills and knowledge necessary to take on more senior roles in their field. For example, a graduate with a master's degree in engineering may be able to work as a project manager or lead engineer, while a graduate with a doctorate in engineering may be able to work as a research scientist or university professor.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to providing graduates with the skills and knowledge necessary to advance their careers, a master's degree or doctorate in engineering can also help graduates to earn higher salaries. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, engineers with a master's degree earn a median annual salary of $100,000, while engineers with a doctorate in engineering earn a median annual salary of $110,000. This is significantly higher than the median annual salary of $85,000 for engineers with only a bachelor's degree.
</p>
<p>
  If you are interested in advancing your career in engineering, pursuing a master's degree or doctorate in engineering is a great option. Online engineering bachelor's degree programs provide a flexible and affordable way to earn the necessary qualifications to pursue a higher degree.
