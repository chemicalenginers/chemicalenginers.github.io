<p>
  Networking is a critical consideration when choosing a game engine. If you are planning on creating a multiplayer game, you will need to make sure that the game engine you choose supports multiplayer gaming and offers the networking features that you need.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Dedicated Servers:</strong> Dedicated servers are used to host multiplayer games. They are separate from the game client and run on their own computer. Dedicated servers can provide a more stable and reliable gaming experience than peer-to-peer networking.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Peer-to-Peer Networking:</strong> Peer-to-peer networking is a type of networking where each player's computer acts as both a server and a client. This can be a less expensive and more flexible option than dedicated servers, but it can also be less reliable.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cross-Platform Play:</strong> Cross-platform play allows players on different platforms (such as PC, consoles, and mobile devices) to play together. This can be a great way to expand your game's audience.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Voice Chat:</strong> Voice chat allows players to communicate with each other during gameplay. This can be a great way to improve teamwork and coordination.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  When choosing a game engine, it is important to consider the networking features that you need. The best game engine for you will be the one that supports the networking features that you need and provides the performance that you require.
</p>
<h3>Modding</h3>

    <br/>
</center>
<p>
  Modding is the process of modifying a game's files to change its gameplay, graphics, or other features. Modding can be a great way to extend the life of a game and make it more enjoyable for players. When choosing a game engine, it is important to consider whether or not it supports modding and how easy it is to mod the game.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Modding Tools:</strong> Some game engines provide built-in modding tools that make it easy to create and install mods. These tools can streamline the modding process and make it more accessible to.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Modding Community:</strong> A large and active modding community can make it easier to find and install mods for your game. A supportive modding community can also provide help and resources to modders.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Open Source:</strong> Open-source game engines allow modders to access the source code of the game. This can give modders more freedom to create complex and ambitious mods.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Moddability:</strong> Some games are more moddable than others. This is often due to the game's design and architecture. Games with a modular design are typically easier to mod than games with a more monolithic design.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  When choosing a game engine, it is important to consider how easy it is to mod the game. If you are interested in creating or using mods, you will want to choose a game engine that supports modding and provides the tools and resources that you need.
